### Link Stone

- Added items - **Gray Shard** and **Link Stone**
  - Wild Wailmer have a 5% chance to be encountered holding a Gray Shard
  - Link Stones can be received from the Diving Treasure Hunter on Route 124 in exchange for a Gray Shard
  - The Link Stone can be used to evolve Pokémon which would typically only evolve via trading
    - If the Pokémon would typically require an additional held item in order to evolve via trading (e.g. Scyther with Metal Coat), that item must also be held when using a Link Stone for the evolution to proceed
    - All Pokémon can still be evolved via their typical methods in addition to using the Link Stone

### Pokémon Summary Screen

  - The Pokémon Stats page displays the Pokémon's base stats, IVs, and EVs, as well as the sum total of each
  - Additionally, a gauge of hearts indicates the Pokémon's Friendship level with the player

## Change Log

### Bag

 - The Bag can now be sorted by Index, Name, or Usage by pressing START in the Bag menu
   - TMs and Berries will be sorted alphabetically by Berry/Move name when sorting by Name
   - Graphic added to Bag menu to indicate Sort functionality
 - Picking up or receiving an item whilst the relevant Bag Pocket is full will automatically transfer that item to the PC
 - A **Medicine** pocket has been added between the Items and Poké Balls pocket to store healing, stat-boosting, and battle items
   - The Bag graphic in the Bag menu has been updated to reflect the extra pocket

### Hyper Training

- Added items - **Bottle Cap**, **Rusted Cap**, and **Gold Cap**
  - Bottle Caps and Rusted Caps can be purchased from the Battle Frontier Vitamin Vendor for 1BP each
  - Gold Caps can also be purchased from the Battle Frontier Vitamin Vendor for 5BP each

- Added NPC - **Mr. Hyper**
  - Mr. Hyper can be found in the Battle Tents in Slateport City, Verdanturf Town, and Fallarbor Town
  - Mr. Hyper offers to Hyper Train Pokémon in the player's party in return for a Bottle Cap, Rusted Cap, or Gold Cap
  - Hyper Training can increase or reduce a Pokémon's IVs depending on the item exchanged
    - Exchanging a Bottle Cap allows the player to maximise the IVs of one stat of a Pokémon to 31
    - Exchanging a Rusted Cap allows the player to minimise the IVs of one stat of a Pokémon to 0
    - Exchanging a Gold Cap allows the player to maximise the IVs of all stats of a Pokémon to 31

### Link Stone

- Added items - **Gray Shard** and **Link Stone**
  - Wild Wailmer have a 5% chance to be encountered holding a Gray Shard
  - Link Stones can be received from the Diving Treasure Hunter on Route 124 in exchange for a Gray Shard
  - The Link Stone can be used to evolve Pokémon which would typically only evolve via trading
    - If the Pokémon would typically require an additional held item in order to evolve via trading (e.g. Scyther with Metal Coat), that item must also be held when using a Link Stone for the evolution to proceed
    - All Pokémon can still be evolved via their typical methods in addition to using the Link Stone

### Pokémon Summary Screen
